This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP when performing deep comparisons of objects. The `foo` function attempts to recursively compare two objects, checking for equality in keys and values. However, it fails to handle cases where objects have the same keys but values that are themselves objects that are not deeply equal.  The solution provides a corrected function that addresses this issue, using a more robust deep comparison technique.
